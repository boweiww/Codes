Select can be used to handle time exceed.
For expample, for a blocked function read in C. the read will return nothing until all the file is read
we can just raise a select to handle that if the time is exceed limit, directly go to next instruction
this could be very useful fot some block functions.

sometimes there could be some strange problems happens.
If so, try printf and strcpy, it might helps

val = atoi(str) atoi can transfer string into an integer.

remember that argc is an integer and argv[] is a list of strings.
